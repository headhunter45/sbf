// Test lifecycle
// suite_setup_function(); - This is called to allocate any suite level resources. This is called once when the suite begins.
// These functions may be called in parallel but execution will not proceed past this block until they have all finished.
//   test_setup_function(); - This is called once for every test in tests. You may use it to allocate resources or setup mocks, stubs, and spies.
//   function_to_test(...); - This is called once for every test to execute the test.
//   Only one of these test functions will actually be run for each test in tests. They should return true if the test passed, return false if the test failed or there was an error, and be nullptr if they should be skipped. The executed function will be called with expected_output and the result of function_to_test(...). They can be used to test functions with side effects, especially void functions.
//   test_compare_function; - This is the highest priority compare function. If it is not nullptr then it will be called.
//   suite_compare_function; - This is the second highest priority compare function. If test_compare_function is nullptr and this is not nullptr then it will be called.
//   [](TResult expected, TResult actual) { return expected, actual; } - This is the lowest priority compare function. If all other compare functions are nullptr then this will be called to evaluate the test.
//   test_teardown_function(); - This is called once for every test in tests. You must free/release any resources allocated by test_setup_function.
// This ends the parallel test functions section all tests will have completed before execution proceeds.
// Collect reports - Ths step is not visible to the user at this point, but data returned by all of the test functions is collected here. This is where you will eventually be able to format/log data for reports.
// suite_teardown_function(); - This is called after all test calls have completed, all test_teardown_function calls have completed, and all test reports/logs have been written. You should free any resources allocated in suite_setup_function.

    //   TFunctionToTest function_to_test - This is the function to test. This may be replaced if necessary by std::function. It may not currently support class methods, but that is planned.
    //   vector<tuple<...>> tests - This is the test run data. Each tuple in the vector is a single test run. It's members are explained below.

    //     TResult expected_output - This is the expected result of executing this test.
    //     bool(*)(const TResult expected, const TResult actual) test_compare_function - This is optional. If unset or set to nullptr it is skipped. If set to a function it is called to evaluate the test results. It takes the expected and actual results as parameters and should return true if the test passed and false otherwise. This may be changed to return a TestResults at some point.
    //     void(*)(TInputParams...) test_setup_function - This is optional. If unset or set to nullptr it is skipped. If set to a function it is called before each test to setup the environment for the test. You may use it to allocate resources and setup mocks, stubs, and spies.
    //     void(*)(TInputParams...) test_teardown_function - This is optiona. If unset or set to nullptr it is skipped. If set to a function it is called after each test to cleanup the environment after the test. You should free resources allocated by test_setup_function.
    //     bool is_enabled - This is optional. If unset or set to true the test is run. If set to false this test is skipped. If skipped it will be reported as a skipped/disabled test.
    //   bool(*)(const TResult expected, const TResult actual) suite_compare_function - This is optional. If unset or set to nullptr it is skipped. If set to a function and test_compare_function is not called for a test run then this function is called to evaluate the test results. It takes the expected and actual results as parameters and should return true if the test passed and false otherwise. This may be changed to return a TestResults at some point.
    //   void(*)() suite_setup_function - This is optional. If unset or set to nullptr it is skipped. If set to a function it is called before starting this test suite to setup the environment. You may use it to allocate resources and setup mocks, stubs, and spies.

    //     return results;
    //   }
    // Then some test harness either generated or explicit can call test_main_ThingDoer(...) and optionally reported there. Reporting granularity is controlled by how frequently you call collect_and_report_test_results(...).
    // You can combine test results with results = results + function_to_test(..); and then collect_and_report_test_results on the aggregate TestResults value.
